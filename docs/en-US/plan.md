## Plan
### FileTemplate
- Support for multi file template engine
> Currently, only pure text processing is available

### Custom language
- Expose interfaces to allow custom parsing

### Binary file processing
- Allow parsing of binary files (if there is a corresponding parser)


### selector-value mode
- The default selector is mainly based on tags for querying, which will result in each query needing to check the syntax tree for confirmation

- Preparing to change to query primarily based on value
