## FAQ


### Will the modified resources be synced to all editors?
- No, it needs to be refreshed; or waiting for the next startup.

### How to terminate the currently running action?
- Currently, it cannot be terminated. If a deadlock occurs due to custom rule design, it may be necessary to kill the process or restart the window.
- In the future, the plugin will run on independent threads, which will not affect the overall use of the plugin.
